* Nested associations.
  Possible notation?
         Insert.Note.fresh(:note))]])

* rename `params_from_repo` to `update_params(note_free: Insert.animal, except: [...])`

* Have workflow annotate examples with line numbers (make it a macro)
  Display the filename and line number upon errors in format that allows
  click to reach example.

* Make mockery come along with ecto_test_dsl

* How will as_cast work with associations? (like as_cast with notes) in multi-note insertion?

* Notation for stubbed field_transformation
           # date: on_success(Date.utc_today, stubbed: ~D[2001-01-02])) |>
  This is intended to be an alterative to creating a special test just to
  set up a mock:

  test "creation" do
    given(Date.utc_today, return: ~D[2001-01-01])
    Tester.check_workflow(:note, trace: false)
  end


* Pull `given` out into a mockery_extras package.

* Rearrange examples directory structures, probably delete
  names. Along the way, figure out a better naming convention for examples files.
