A "little language" that lets you write a set of examples in a
declarative style that generates a set of test data ("examples"),
appropriate assertions for each example, and runners that check the
examples against the assertions.

You get terse tests and examples that explain a lot in (comparatively) few words. 

The separate repository [examples_for_ecto_test_dsl/](https://github.com/marick/examples_for_ecto_test_dsl/) shows example.

*This is a work in progress. However, I am actively looking for people who'd like me to try applying this package to their repo and thus improve it.*
