# A variant of `ex_pi`

This variant of `ex_pi` differs from the original in that:


1. The pretty-printing macro is `pp` (with an extra `p`) because `pi`
   is too liable to have false grep/ag hits.
   
2. The label is shorter to fit a smallish window without wrapping.

3. I hate typing strings as labels (two shift key presses!), so I
   allow it to take atoms.
